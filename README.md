  - This Would Help Check For Correctness
  
- Make Code Easier To Read
- Document More Code
- Finish File Directory System
- Finish Complier Command Line Arguments
- Code Generation
- Compile Time Checks


### Currently
- New Parsing System
  - Splits The String From The File
  - Finds The Row And Column Of The Code
